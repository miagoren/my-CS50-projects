# Project 0 - My Quarantine Routine

## My Website
In my website I wrote about what I do in quarantine. I used several html elements that were presented in class.\n
I used a navigation bar provided by Bootstrap to link all of the different pages and I used an SCSS stylesheet to edit the look of my webpages.\n
The font-size of the text in all of the pages is adjusting according to the size of the screen using a media query.

### The Homepage
The website's homepage includes a short paragraph and an image.

### cook.html
This page includes a recipe that is organized using lists (organized lists and unorganized lists).

### crochet.html
In this page I used Bootstrap's column property to organize the contents of the page.

### dailyRoutine.html
Here I presented my daily routine using a table.
